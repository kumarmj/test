# Chapter 1: The role of algorithms in Computing
# In this chapter, we will answer these questions

# What are algorithms?
# An algorithm is thus a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the output

# e.g. let's define sorting problem
# Input: A sequence of n numbers a1, a2,...an.
# Output: Produce a reordering where a1 < a2 < .. < an 

nums = [2, 1, 5, 4, 3]
print("Input: ", end='')
print(nums)
print("Problem: Produce ordering where a1 < a2 < .. < an")
print("Output: ", end='')
print(sorted(nums))

# Which algorithm is best for a given application depends on—among other factors—
# - the number of items to be sorted, the extent to which the items are already somewhat sorted, possible restrictions on the item values,
# - the architecture of the computer, and the kind of storage devices to be used: main memory, disks, or even tapes.

# Why is the study of algorithms worthwhile ?

# What is the role of algorithms relative to other technologies used in computers ?
